Hexcrawler Synopsis 2026

This project is to build a lightweight, deterministic, modular “Hexcrawl Simulation Engine” with an integrated in-game world editor, explicitly designed to deliver an OSR-faithful experience while remaining extensible across rules paradigms and future modes. The engine’s identity is hexcrawl-first rather than “an RPG with a hex option”: the hex grid is a native data structure, world state is keyed to hex coordinates, and the world persists and advances whether the player is present or not. The intended player experience is hardcore, gritty, and consequence-driven: no HP bloat, no rubber-banding, no enemy scaling, no safety rails, and a strong commitment to lethality, scarcity, and emergent problem-solving. The core commercial differentiator is not cosmetic OSR styling but systemic integrity: a world that does not care, where actions change the ecology, factions react, and death and injury are meaningful, persistent, and legible. In short, the engine exists to make real hexcrawls possible in a way that is both playable and expandable for a decade.
At the heart of the design is a strict separation between simulation, rules modules, and presentation. The simulation runs on a continuous clock with deterministic tick-based “accounting” under the hood: scheduled checks for encounters, fatigue, supplies, noise, and AI evaluation occur at defined intervals, preserving OSR time pressure and resource attrition even when moment-to-moment gameplay is real-time. This accounting layer is non-negotiable because it enforces consequence and prevents the engine from drifting into generic action-RPG behavior. Overland travel can feel like a running clock while still producing periodic, inspectable risk checks; dungeon exploration remains immersive and real-time but is governed by declared, time-costly exploration actions (search, listen, force doors, rest). In single-player, the UX may optionally accelerate time during committed actions; in multiplayer, the same actions simply consume real time, ensuring no core mechanic assumes global time acceleration. Multiplayer is a strong long-term goal, especially for longevity and PvP, but it must be treated as an architectural constraint rather than a v1 feature: deterministic simulation, event-based state updates, and a clean separation between simulation and input/rendering are required so that no design choice forecloses future authoritative-server multiplayer.
The engine’s signature combat concept is the “Hotline OSR syncretism”: real-time, brutal, decisive medieval fighting that feels physical and sickeningly consequential, yet is strategically OSR in structure. The guiding principle is “information > reflexes.” Combat should reward scouting, positioning, preparation, and system mastery more than twitch skill, while still allowing violence to be fast and final. Movement is slower and weightier than arcade action; actions have commitment windows; blocking/defending is an intentional stance with tradeoffs; enemies can advance in formations and break on morale. A targeted-combat interface is contemplated: a fast “voodoo doll” targeting overlay where torso is the default (clicking an enemy attacks center mass) but precise targeting is available when the player chooses to trade speed for specificity. The camera should remain tight—roughly two to three rooms on screen—to keep armor, posture, and tactical intent readable and to support future PvP clarity. Combat outcomes are designed to create cascades of consequence rather than depletion of large HP pools, preserving lethality and the emotional weight of each decision to push forward or retreat.
Wounds are the primary consequence model and replace modern regeneration-centric abstractions. The injury system must remain “caveman-readable” while being internally sound: a small vocabulary of tangible wounds (broken leg, punctured lung, severed tendon, concussion, deep cut, infection, poison) mapped onto defined body parts/regions with severity, effects, treatment, recovery time, and complications. Wounds should enable grim, memorable agency: dragging yourself out of a dungeon with a broken leg, choosing to amputate an infected limb, sacrificing blood at an altar, cutting off an arm when trapped, or removing a cursed eye. Healing and scars may produce lasting character changes or even situational boons, but without undermining the core thesis that mistakes are costly and survival is earned. Corpses persist on the map; death can be hard permadeath by design, with optional modes later, but the default expectation is that the world continues without you.
Armor and weapons are treated as tactical realities, not numeric inflation. The cornerstone mechanic is penetration thresholds rather than “reduce damage” or “add HP”: late medieval armor should categorically negate certain attack vectors below a penetration level, while still allowing blunt trauma, stagger, fatigue shock, and secondary effects on non-penetrative hits. Armor imposes tradeoffs—movement, stamina, agility, noise, heat/fatigue—and coverage and arcs matter (front/side/rear) without requiring full physics simulation. Some bounded uncertainty is retained (angle classes, coverage assumptions, impact variance) to avoid deterministic exploitation, but the system should remain learnable and mastery-driven. Non-penetrative attacks should still have meaningful outcomes (glancing blows, brief stuns, forced spacing, armor degradation, morale effects), which keeps fights dynamic even when armor “does its job.”
Information, not UI markers, drives exploration. The engine must implement diegetic intelligence: rumors, tracks, signs, faction behavior, and environmental cues that point to opportunities and threats without turning into quest-marker chores. Rather than “kill 20 orcs,” the world should model 20 orcs as an actual threat actor who raids farms, leaves tracks, triggers NPC complaints, and alters settlement behavior. This requires persistent entities (bands, lairs, patrols) with simple needs and reactions—Dwarf Fortress–style emergence without deep reasoning trees. Rumors are generated from structured world events using templates, propagate socially with confidence and decay, and should be capped at roughly 3–5 propagation hops to avoid noise and debugging collapse, while allowing multi-layer causal chains in the simulation itself (weather → scarcity → raids → complaints → rumors) through shallow, composable systems. The goal is a world that remains interpretable: players should be able to form hypotheses, investigate, and see the world change in ways that feel earned and coherent.
The editor is a first-class product, comparable in spirit to an Age of Empires map editor, and should be enjoyable enough to stand on its own. Users who “don’t know what Notepad is” must be able to paint terrain, place sites, define spawners and patrols, edit encounter and rumor tables, configure factions, and preview simulations. Internally, content is data-driven and schema-validated so it can scale to hundreds of enemies, weapons, armors, terrains, and spells without engine rewrites; the core promise is that content expansion becomes a balance and authoring problem, not a code problem. The OSR hexcrawl loop the engine must support is: Desire (often wealth/progression) drives action; information is acquired diegetically; the player prepares; travels; discovers; commits; survives or dies; returns to recover and convert loot into capability; and the world state shifts, producing new information and renewed desire. This loop is the engine’s organizing principle and scope filter: systems that strengthen persistent consequence, information scarcity, meaningful preparation, and lethal resolution are prioritized; features that dilute those are excluded or deferred.
